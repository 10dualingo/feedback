# menfess
custom built, simple, minimalistic anonymous messaging system built for 10.2, class of 2024/25.

this concept is heavily based on [ngl.link](https://ngl.link), and is popularised by multiple classes from various different schools in Indonesia.

> why fit into the norm when you can be different? (and build your own ngl.link themed around your own class)
